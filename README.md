# For now what FINANCIALDROID can do:

- Add a expense giving the price, the type of the expense, some text that describes the expense, and the date when the expense was added;

- Check last month expenses on the expense viewer, here you can sort your recent expenses by category, price or date. If you tap one expense, it will appear a dialog if you want to delete that expense;

- What you can do in expense viewer, you can do also in archive, though archive is for expenses that have more than a month. Here you can reset your archive too, it will erase all expenses that you have in the archive;

- In the analytics viewer you can check a simple chart with the expenses made last month(for now).
